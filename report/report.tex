  \section*{WACC Project Report}


  \subsection*{1. The Final Product}
  \textit{An analysis and critical evaluation of the quality of the WACC compiler
  have built. You should consider both whether it meets the functional
  specification of the project and whether you judge that it forms a sound basis
  for future development. You may also wish to address the performance
  characteristics of your compiler.}

  We deemed our implementation of the WACC compiler to have completed the
  functional requirements of the specification to a satisfactory degree, as
  evidenced by the test results, in addition to which we also included
  additional test cases for edge cases that were not covered by the original set.
  Our implementation of the WACC compiler also provided us with a expandable
  platform from with additional functionalities, and language features can be
  added. The lexer and parser can easily be expanded to include new language
  features. The syntactic and semantic analysis, owing to our design choices in
  the implementation of errors as bundles, allows for the easy addition of new
  syntax and semantic error types, under new conditions, whilst maintaining the
  ability to gather all thrown error messages in one compilation attempt.
  Our design choice surrounding machine code generation also allows for
  additional arm instructions to be implemented into the compiler, whether it is
  to replace previous implementations or as part of a new language feature.

  \hl{Performance characteristics of our compiler?}


  \subsection*{2. Project Management}
  \textit{An analysis of the organization of your group and your use of project
  management tools (such as Git). You should describe how your group was
  structured, how you coordinated your work and detail any tools that
  helped/hindered your progress. You should also discuss what went well and what
  you would do differently if you were to do the lab again.}

  \subsection*{3. Design Choices and Implementation Details}
  \textit{An analysis of the design choices that your made during the WACC
  project, including your implementation and language and tool choices (with
  justifications), and any interesting issues you had to overcome during the
  implementation of your compiler. You should discuss the design patterns you
  used when designing your code and why you chose to use them. You might also
  want to provide a system architecture diagram for your compiler to aid this
  discussion.}

  \subsection*{4. Beyond the Specification}
  \textit{An evaluation of your extensions to your WACC compiler. You should
  describe all the language extensions, optimizations or other aspects that you
  have added to your compiler, especially highlighting how these features can be
  accessed or viewed. You should also briefly discuss what future extensions you
  would add to your compiler if you had more time.}

  \section*{WACC Project Report}


  \subsection*{1. The Final Product}
  \textit{An analysis and critical evaluation of the quality of the WACC compiler
  have built. You should consider both whether it meets the functional
  specification of the project and whether you judge that it forms a sound basis
  for future development. You may also wish to address the performance
  characteristics of your compiler.}

  \subsection*{2. Project Management}
  \textit{An analysis of the organization of your group and your use of project
  management tools (such as Git). You should describe how your group was
  structured, how you coordinated your work and detail any tools that
  helped/hindered your progress. You should also discuss what went well and what
  you would do differently if you were to do the lab again.}

  \subsection*{3. Design Choices and Implementation Details}
  \textit{An analysis of the design choices that your made during the WACC
  project, including your implementation and language and tool choices (with
  justifications), and any interesting issues you had to overcome during the
  implementation of your compiler. You should discuss the design patterns you
  used when designing your code and why you chose to use them. You might also
  want to provide a system architecture diagram for your compiler to aid this
  discussion.}

  \subsection*{4. Beyond the Specification}
  \textit{An evaluation of your extensions to your WACC compiler. You should
  describe all the language extensions, optimizations or other aspects that you
  have added to your compiler, especially highlighting how these features can be
  accessed or viewed. You should also briefly discuss what future extensions you
  would add to your compiler if you had more time.}
